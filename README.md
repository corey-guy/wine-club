Call of Duty and Wine, What?
----------------------------
This is the repository for an application that organizes a 'wine club' where a 
group of people can sign up to create an organized platform for who's drinking
which wine on which weekend and who's picking the loadout class for the boys
when they drop on Piccadilly.

It all started at the beginning of quarantine...and with a fresh batch of mid 
entering late 20s bachelors who were celebrating the marriage of their buddy
chuchutrain. What a guy. What a weekend. Anyways. They got together at the
start of quarantine, every sunday to drink a new flavour of 
wine without truly understanding the characteristics of the red social 
lubricant and to best a bunch of sweaty teenagers in 5v5 Search and Destroy. 

Developer Notes 
---------------
This app has a facebook integration, so you will need a facebookSecret.js
file in the server folder that supplies app.js with a clientID and a 
clientSecret.
